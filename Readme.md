## Informal explanation

An informal explanation of what this all means (this part is not legalese and can't be treated as such)

VertexDezign (we) wrote the Mod and we have the copyright on this Mod. That means the code is ours and we can
do with it what we want. It also means you can't just copy our code and use it for your own projects. 
Only we can distribute the Mod to others. We allow you to make small changes for your own gameplay or with your friends.
But you are not allowed to publish these changes openly. When you make a contribution (translations, code changes) you
give that code to us. Otherwise we would not be able to publish this Mod anymore.
If you lose your savegame or if your computer crashes due to our Mod, you can tell us and we will attempt to fix the
mod but we will not be paying for a new computer nor getting your savegame back. (Make backups!)
